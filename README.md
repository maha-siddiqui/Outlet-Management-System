# Outlet-Management-System
This C++ console application allows customers to browse and purchase products by navigating through different sections for women, men, and kids. It uses various char and string variables to capture user choices and login details. The order struct helps manage items with attributes like size, itemName, and price, storing up to 10 orders. Functions such as productDetails (with and without color options) enable detailed product selection, while saveFeedback records customer feedback into a file. Sections like womenSection and menSection provide specific product options for each category, guiding users through their shopping experience.
